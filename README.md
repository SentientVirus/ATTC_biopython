# ATTC_biopython
Repository for the project of a course in basic Python and Biopython

## Project description
I am taking the pedagogic teaching course right now, and for my pedagogic project I 
wanted to design a basic course, *Bioinformatics in Python*, that is intended for 
beginners. The idea is to upload basic scripts here, or possibly a series of Jupyter 
Notebooks where students would be able to run the course and that could also be 
converted to PDF and used as lecture notes.

## Instructions
If possible, use the provided Anaconda environment to run the notebooks. The environment contains most of the software that is used in this "fake" course. I created the environment in my MacOS Ventura (13.2.1), so some of the packages might not be compatible with other OS. The idea is that the notebooks should be run in the order that is indicated (following their numbers), and I should have made many other notebooks explaining the basic foundations of Python, but I didn't have time, and I think it will not be very interesting for this Advanced Programming in Python course anyway since they would be too basic. Please let me know if I should add more content to the project, but I hope that what I submitted so far is enough, and I hope that perhaps you can learn something even though as a course project it is still really far from being complete.
