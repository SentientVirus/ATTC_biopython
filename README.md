# ATTC_biopython
Repository for the project of a course in basic Python and Biopython

## Project description
I am taking the pedagogic teaching course right now, and for my pedagogic project I 
wanted to design a basic course, *Bioinformatics in Python*, that is intended for 
beginners. The idea is to upload basic scripts here, or possibly a series of Jupyter 
Notebooks where students would be able to run the course and that could also be 
converted to PDF and used as lecture notes.
