# ATTC_biopython
Repository for the project of a course in basic Python and Biopython

## Project description
Here I created course material for a new course, *Basic Python for Biologists*, that is intended for 
beginners.  In this course, I aim to replace traditional lectures with interactive tutorials as the main form of instruction. The tutorials so far consists are six Jupyter Notebooks, of which tutorials 1-3 teach basic Python contents, and tutorials 4-6 teach how to use Biopython and other Python libraries that can be used to parse and display biological data.

## Instructions
If you don't have Anaconda, follow the instructions in the PDF of the first tutorial (Introduction) to get started. If 
possible, use the provided Anaconda environment to run the notebooks. The environment contains most of the software that is 
used in this "fake" course. I created the environment in my MacOS Ventura (13.2.1), so some of the packages might not be 
compatible with other OS. The idea is that the notebooks should be run in the order that is indicated (following their 
numbers). Enjoy!
