# ATTC_biopython
Repository for the project of a course in basic Python and Biopython

## Project description
I am taking the pedagogic teaching course right now, and for my pedagogic project I 
wanted to design a basic course, *Bioinformatics in Python*, that is intended for 
beginners. The idea is to upload basic scripts here, or possibly a series of Jupyter 
Notebooks where students would be able to run the course and that could also be 
converted to PDF and used as lecture notes.

## Instructions
If you don't have Anaconda, follow the instructions in the PDF of the first tutorial (Introduction) to get started. If 
possible, use the provided Anaconda environment to run the notebooks. The environment contains most of the software that is 
used in this "fake" course. I created the environment in my MacOS Ventura (13.2.1), so some of the packages might not be 
compatible with other OS. The idea is that the notebooks should be run in the order that is indicated (following their 
numbers). Enjoy!
