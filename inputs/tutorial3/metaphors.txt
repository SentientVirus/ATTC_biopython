It was the last day of June. We were only one week past the longest day of the year. I could hear the cicadas sing, their 
crackling loud as fire wood burning to ashes. I was starting to regret that trip. One of my cousins had invited me to her 
summer house, located in the village where our mothers were born. When I received her invitation, my first instinct was to turn 
it down: The village was as welcoming as an active volcano in the summer. But my cousin insisted that I hadn't seen my family 
for too long, nurtured my homesickness with a collection of happy memories. In the end, I swear, I was looking forward to the 
damn trip. That changed as soon as I arrived to the summer house and felt the warmth of the sun on my scalp, patting my head 
and piercing my eyes with its claws. Let me tell you: light is sharper than steel. The breeze was dry and carried dust as if it 
was blowing from the desert. Plants around me were golden and dead like the statue of an old hero. The nearest body of water 
was a lagoon on the mountainside that glimmered like silver from the 
summer house.
