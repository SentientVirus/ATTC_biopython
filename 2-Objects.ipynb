    "An object can be anything in the real world that we want to represent in our code. YOU (yes, you), for example, could be an object: you would have attributes such as hair type, height, favourite ice-cream flavor, horoscope sign, etc. You would also have methods, for example, you can walk around, jump, sit down, smile, cry. If you could be simulated in a computer programme, there would be methods to make you move or smile as I mentioned. Unfortunately, people are too complex to be simulated in a programme, so we will have to use a simpler object as an example: the number one."
