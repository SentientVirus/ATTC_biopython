    "## What is the purpose?\n",
    "The idea is that the computer **performs a task for us**. The task can be, for example, a complicated mathematical calculation, or even a simple one like in the example. It can also be a different type of task, like displaying an image or sorting data. These are examples of basic tasks, but it can be more complex, like managing a server or running a genome analysis pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the main advantages of programming is that it allows us to **automate tasks**. In addition, a computer programme will usually give us the same answer from the same input data, which is not so easy when we perform a lab experiment. This means that, in theory, it should be **more reproducible**. However, in practice, you need access to the instructions that have been fed to the computer, not just the inputs and outputs, and these methods are often not published."

    "## How does it work?\n",
    "This is quite simple: you feed the inputs and the instructions to the computer, then this code (**source code**) is processed by a **compiler**, which \"translates\" it to a language that the computer can understand (**object code**). Usually, a programme is made up of several pieces of code called **modules**. These modules are put together by a **linker**. Often, even single-module programmes need to be linked after they are combined, because linkers also replace symbolic links (\"fake\" addresses that you create to point to the true addresses of files) with true addresses. After the compiler and the linker have done their work, you get the so-called **machine code**, the final instructions that your machine will execute.\n",
    "\n",
    "To summarize, the process works as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Writing source code\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Compiling code\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Linking code\n",

    "According to Stack Overflow's 2022 Developer Survey, Python is the fourth most used programming language, with a 48.07% of respondents using Python. Among those who are learning to code, the number goes up to 58.38%. Let's display it more nicely:"

There are no bigger walls than this one. Bear with me. Continue reading, I promise you it will be worth it... or maybe not. Actually, not at all. Sorry about this, I just wanted to make a point. Blah blah blah. And I could keep going. Yes, this is a threat. Okay, maybe this is enough. Maybe not.\n",
